BPSK Modulation: BER vs. SNR Analysis
This project simulates the Bit Error Rate (BER) vs. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) modulation. It compares the simulated BER with the theoretical BER to evaluate the performance of BPSK under various SNR conditions.

📂 Project Structure
bpsk_ber_vs_snr.py: Main Python code for simulating and plotting BER vs. SNR.
README.md: Documentation for the project.

⚙️ How It Works
BPSK Modulation:

Input bits (0 or 1) are modulated into symbols (-1 or +1).
Noise Addition:

Gaussian noise is added to simulate channel imperfections.
Decision Process:

Receiver makes a decision: If the received signal > 0, bit = 1; otherwise, bit = 0.
BER Calculation:

Simulated BER is computed by comparing transmitted and received bits.
Theoretical BER is calculated using the Q-function.
🛠️ Customization
Modify num_bits to change the number of bits simulated.
Adjust the snr_db_range to analyze a wider or narrower SNR range.
